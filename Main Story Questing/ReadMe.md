1. Set the BotBase dropdown to `OrderBot`.

The bot will automatically progress through each expansion in order. There is no need to load different scripts yourself.

## Required Manual Intervention

Some steps need to be completed manually -- a popup will appear with a "ding" sound to notify you. These are usually dungeons without official Duty Support/Trusts, or solo duties too complex to script.
