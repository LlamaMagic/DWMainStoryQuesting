AutoParty is an usual botbase that I developed mainly for my own use but thought someone else might get some use out of it.

It's designed to be running on a "carry" (typically a high level character) character and automates running a lower level character through dungeons. It doesn't support every dungeon, but does support /most/ of the dungeons that need to be ran during MSQ.

## Installation

Follow the installation instructions for SVN checkout [here](https://wiki.llamaserver.com/doku.php?id=domesticsponsorsinstalltion).

## Usage

On carry character:
1. On the high level carry character, move to the Aelport aethertye.
2. Click start on RB with the AutoParty botbase selected in the botbase settings.

On the character to be carried:
1. *Open the profile that supports AutoParty and change the UseCarry entity to 1 and set the carry's name on the CarryName entity. Only the first name is needed in most cases.
2. Load the profile in OrderBot and hit 'Start'.


** All of the MSQ profiles in this pack support AutoParty. They should have the UseCarry and CarryName entities at the top. Enabling this will cause the low level character to teleport to Aelport, invite the carry character, and load the dungeon. Essentially enabling running of the MSQ dungeons without needing any input on your part.


## Troubleshooting

I'm probably not going to be providing too much support for this as it's pretty buggy. Definitly not something I ever intend to release tot he wild. Just thought it might come in handy for those of you starting fresh characters. If you have any questions though, feel free to reach out to me on discord and I'll try my best to help out.
